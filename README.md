A simple project that calculates if you are getting tenough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator.

For use:
Change the amount of hours input on each return statement in my getSleepHours function to the amount of sleep that you are actually getting as well as the amount of ideal sleep you would like to get in the getIdealSleepHours function and run the program for the result.
